# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Islands: `Wiki.App.Islands.component` draws a formula (KaTeX), a diagram
  (Mermaid) or highlighted code (highlight.js) into an element Halogen renders
  empty and holds by ref, and draws it again when its input changes. Its input
  is an `Island` (`MathInline`, `MathDisplay`, `Mermaid`, `CodeBlock`), so a
  page renders all its islands through one slot type. The component's monad
  needs `MonadIslands` (instances for `BrowserDOM`, natively `MemDOM`, and
  `ReaderT` over either) and `MonadUUID`. Natively an island holds its source
  as text, which is what the prerendered page shows until the program loads.
- The page loads `islands.js` and `islands.css`, which `web/bundle.sh` builds
  from npm's `katex`, `mermaid` and `highlight.js`; Mermaid is fetched only
  when the first diagram is drawn.
- A browser test suite, `wiki-app-browser-test`, runs in headless Chromium with
  that bundle loaded.
