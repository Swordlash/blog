# blog

A Confluence-style wiki, written in Haskell with
[haskell-halogen](https://github.com/Swordlash/haskell-halogen) and compiled to
WebAssembly for the browser.

What it is for: spaces and subspaces, each a tree of pages written in Markdown, with
Mermaid diagrams, LaTeX (inline and block), highlighted code, images, video and other
attachments, previewed live in the browser as you write. Users, groups and permissions
on spaces decide who may read, edit or administer what; a space can be public, which
makes the same application a blog.

How it is built: the browser application is Halogen components over a backend
interface, implemented once in memory (a serverless demo deployable as static files)
and once over HTTP to a Haskell server with persistence. Markdown is parsed and
rendered to Halogen HTML in the browser, so the preview never waits for a server.

So far there is the serverless demo: the shell (spaces in a tree, their pages,
breadcrumbs, a search box, a user switcher instead of a sign-in) over an in-memory
wiki seeded with demo content, pages rendered from Markdown, whose syntax is
described for authors in [docs/markdown.md](docs/markdown.md), with their formulas,
diagrams and code drawn by KaTeX, Mermaid and highlight.js; an editor with the
Markdown beside a live preview, attachments dropped or chosen into it, and a guard
against losing unsaved changes; and creating, renaming, moving and deleting spaces
and pages as the permissions allow. Every route has an address of its own and a
prerendered page. The plan of work is in
[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md): phases from a serverless MVP demo through a
server with persistence to authentication and authorisation.

## Working on it

`AGENTS.md` describes how the work is organised: a planning session cuts the plan into
work packages and delegates each to an implementing agent. Toolchain and conventions
follow haskell-halogen's.

## Toolchain

The toolchain is haskell-halogen's, at the same pins: GHC 9.14.1, cabal 3.16.1.0,
`wasm32-wasi-ghc` 9.14.1.20260731 from ghc-wasm-meta, Node 24 and Chromium for
Playwright. On x86_64 Linux one script installs all of it:

```sh
sh toolchain/bootstrap.sh
```

It installs ghcup into `~/.ghcup` (unless one is already on `PATH`) and through it GHC
and cabal, making them ghcup's defaults; the wasm sysroot into `~/.ghc-wasm` and the
cross compiler through ghcup, as haskell-halogen's CI does; Node into
`~/.wiki-toolchain/node`; and Chromium's headless shell where Playwright keeps its
browsers. Debian packages it needs (GMP's headers, `zstd`, `jq` and a few more) it
installs with `apt-get` when it runs as root or with password-less `sudo`, and names
otherwise. Then it builds the dependencies of `cabal.project` and `cabal-wasm.project`
into the cabal store, so the first build compiles only this repository.

Each step checks whether its tool is already there and working, so running it again is
quick and quiet, and finishes an install that was interrupted. Commands' output goes to
`~/.wiki-toolchain/bootstrap.log`. Afterwards, put `. ~/.wiki-toolchain/env` in your
shell profile for `ghc`, `cabal` and Node 24 on `PATH`; the build scripts source
`~/.ghc-wasm/env` for the wasm tools themselves. `sh toolchain/bootstrap.sh toolchain`
skips the store.

Claude Code cloud sessions run it from the `SessionStart` hooks in `.claude/`: the
toolchain before the session starts, the store in the background. A command that needs
the store complete can wait for that with `sh toolchain/bootstrap.sh warm`.

## Layout

| Directory | Package | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [wiki-core/](wiki-core/) | `wiki-core` | The domain: types, Markdown rendering, permission rules. Native and wasm. |
| [wiki-api/](wiki-api/) | `wiki-api` | Request and response types (aeson), shared by the client and the server. |
| [wiki-app/](wiki-app/) | `wiki-app` | The Halogen application: `wiki-app` (the wasm program) and `wiki-app-prerender` (native: writes the page with the application already rendered into it). |
| [wiki-server/](wiki-server/) | `wiki-server` | The server, native only. A placeholder until Phase 2. |
| [web/](web/) | | The page around the application: `index.html`, `index.js` (loads `app.wasm`), CSS, and `bundle.sh`, which bundles the islands' libraries from `web/src/`. |
| [toolchain/](toolchain/) | | Build and test scripts, adapted from haskell-halogen's. |

haskell-halogen's packages come from one `source-repository-package` stanza in
`cabal.project`, pinned to a commit. `cabal.project` builds every package natively;
`cabal-wasm.project` imports it and builds for wasm with the pinned cross compiler.

## Commands

```sh
npm ci                          # once: Playwright, http-server, esbuild, KaTeX, Mermaid, highlight.js
npm run build-native            # every package, host GHC, into dist-newstyle/native
npm run test-native             # the test suites, natively
npm run build-wasm              # wiki-app to wasm, a prerendered page per route, the islands bundle, into dist-newstyle/wasm/public/app
npm run serve-wasm              # build-wasm, then serve it on http://127.0.0.1:8080
npm run test-wasm               # the test suites on wasm, under Node; wiki-app-browser-test in Chromium
npm run test                    # test-native, then test-wasm
npm run smoke-test              # the built pages in headless Chromium: deep links, clicks, back, reload, islands, the editor
npm run dev-test                # wiki-app-browser-test in browser GHCi, rerun on save (needs ghciwatch)
npm run format                  # fourmolu over every package
npm run clean                   # remove dist-newstyle/wasm/public
```

The islands bundle is `web/bundle.sh <output-dir>`: esbuild bundles KaTeX and
highlight.js (with `web/src/islands.js`) into `islands.js`, which publishes
`globalThis.wikiIslands`; Mermaid into `islands/` as ES modules that `islands.js`
imports the first time it draws a diagram; and KaTeX's stylesheet and fonts into
`islands.css` and `fonts/`. `build-wasm` runs it into the page it builds, and
the browser suite's `wiki-app/test/web/bundle.sh` into the test page. npm 11
runs esbuild's install script only because `package.json`'s `allowScripts`
approves it (`npm install-scripts approve esbuild`).

The browser suite, `wiki-app-browser-test`, is a wasm reactor built with
hspec-halogen: `toolchain/wasm-test-wrapper.sh` recognises it and hands it to
the `hspec-halogen` executable (built natively by `toolchain/build-hspec-halogen.sh`),
which loads it into headless Chromium. Natively it builds and reports that it
skipped. `npm run dev-test` runs it in browser GHCi under ghciwatch;
`sh toolchain/dev-test.sh --repl` and `--open-browser` (from another terminal)
do the same by hand, with `:main` typed into GHCi.

The application routes by path (`/s/<space path>/p/<page path>/`, see
`Wiki.App.Route`) under the page's `<base href>`, which `wiki-app-prerender` writes
from `HALOGEN_BASE_PATH` (default `/`), so the built directory can be served from a
sub-path: `HALOGEN_BASE_PATH=/wiki/ npm run build-wasm`. It writes an `index.html` for
every route the demo starts with and a `404.html` for the rest, which GitHub Pages and
http-server serve for an address with no file.

`serve-wasm` opens the page in a browser; set `PORT` for another port, `NO_OPEN=1` to
not open one. Builds go to `dist-newstyle/native` and `dist-newstyle/wasm`; always
build for wasm through the `toolchain/` scripts, which pass the cross compiler to
cabal explicitly and keep the wasm tools' `CC` away from native builds.

The test suites are hspec, each `main-is: Test.hs` aggregating `Test.*` modules; a
new test module goes into the suite's `other-modules` and `test/Test.hs`. Run one
suite, or one test, with hspec's `--match`:

```sh
cabal test wiki-core:test:wiki-core-test --builddir=dist-newstyle/native \
  --test-options='--match "/Slug/"'
sh toolchain/test-wasm.sh --test-options='--match "/Slug/"'   # extra args go to cabal
```

`npm run format` needs `fourmolu` on `PATH` (`cabal install fourmolu`).
