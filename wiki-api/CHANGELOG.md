## Unreleased

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-22

The first type the client and the server share, `Wiki.Api.Info.ServerInfo`
(the answer to `GET /api/v1/info`), and `apiVersion`, the `v1` in the API's
paths: plain data with aeson instances derived from its `Generic`
representation, the pattern the rest of the API's types will follow when the
server arrives.
